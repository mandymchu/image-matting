## Chroma Keying Based on Stereo Images
Here are some files for my master's thesis that focused on image matting. This chroma keying method is based on stereo images, which can be applied to post-process the alpha matte generated by other matting approaches. 

Given a pair of stereo images, a new matting Laplacian matrix is constructed based on the affinities between matching pixels and their neighbors from two frames. 

Based on the new matting Laplacian matrix, a new cost function is also formulated to estimate alpha values of the reference image through the propagation between stereo images.

To avoid over-smoothing during propagation, a united window with an adaptive size is used in the Laplacian matrix to overcome the dilemma between the inadequate propagation caused by small size windows and the over-smoothness triggered by large size windows.
